Pygmalion
=========

Pygmalion is an effort to bring together those working with [Pig](http://pig.apache.org) with [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org).  My hope is that useful scripts and udfs will be contributed and enhanced
by those interested in using these two technologies together.

[Pygmalion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_%28mythology%29") was a sculptor in Greek mythology that fell in love with one of his sculptures.  I thought it brought together
Pyg, so to speak, and Cassandra as she is also part of Greek mythology.

Welcome.
